=================
 PyWeather
=================

This project is to explore the opportunities of creating large-scale weather/climate simulation in Python.


Implementations
=================

This section collects python implementations of weather and climiate simulations.

miniWeather in Python
---------------------

miniWeather is a mini app simulating weather-like flows for training in parallelizing accelerated HPC architectures developed by Dr. Matthew Norman (https://github.com/mrnorman/miniWeather)

"miniweather" folder includes multiple miniWeather versions written in Pure Python and Python+Accelerators.


Performance
=================

This section discuss about performance issues.


Scalability
=================

This section discuss about large scale simulation.

Accuracy
=================

This section focuses on the accuracy comparisions between conventional Fortran/C/C++ implementations and Pyton implementations.


Data
=================

This sections collects ideas and implementations of data usage especially on taking advantage of Python implementations.


Porting
=================

This section discusses issues related porting weather/climiate codes to Python.


Technologies
=================

This section discusses about underlying technologies that enables Python implementation of large-scale weather/climate simulation.
